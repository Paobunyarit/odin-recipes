  <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>

<p>These garlic noodles are deceivingly simple, yet devastatingly delicious. Garlic noodles were invented back in the '70s at a restaurant in San Francisco called Thanh Long. Usually served with roasted Dungeness crab, 
the recipe is a very closely guarded family secret, but after lots of investigation, and even more experimentation, 
I think this is very close.</p>
